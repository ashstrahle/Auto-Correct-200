# Outlook-Auto-Correct-200

A cheeky little script to teach administrators to lock their session. This script adds 200+ homophone autocorrect entries into Outlook. 

If a colleague with priveleged access leaves their terminal unlocked - run this and restart their Outlook. Whilst hilarity ensues, be sure to reinforce the lesson and good practice of always locking your session. 

The script is harmless and first backs up the current autocorrect file. It will not run if the backup file already exists.

Revert by copying the autocorrect backup file back and restarting Outlook.
