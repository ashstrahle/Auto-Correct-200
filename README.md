# Auto-Correct-200

A naughty little script to teach administrators to lock their terminals. This script adds 200+ homophone autocorrect entries into Outlook. 
It first backs up the current autocorrect file and will not run if the backup file already exists.

Revert by copying the autocorrect backup file back.
